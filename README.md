## Other Concepts and language features
### 159.101
- primitives (explicitly int, float, char, bool)
- boolean logic and logical operators: negations, equivalence, inequalities, &&, ||
- integer arithmetic including modulus.
- realm number arithmetic.
- if/else statements.
- namespaces
- field widths
- While and for loops
- post-increment and post-decrement
- break;
- Arrays
- Bubble Sort
- Functions. Parameters, return types, prototypes.
- Scope (specifically local vs global variables)
- char ascii values
- in/output buffers and flushing the buffer
- strings as an array of characters
- string concatenation
- 2-dimensional arrays
- reading from, writing to, and appending text files (including .csv files)
- fstream::out, fstream::app, fstream::in
- Classes and Objects
- public vs private members
- methods and properties
- c++ strings are objects rather than primitives
- switch statements
### 159.102
- some other primitives (short and double)
- different number systems: binary, octal, hexadecimal
- binary integer representations and related concepts: fixed word sizes, most significant bit, complement+twos complement, carry.
- negative binary integers and binary real number representation
- bitwise operators - &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
- bitmasks
- unsigned variables
- pseudo random numbers. Seeds.
- pointers, calling by reference and calling values by reference
- NULL pointers
- class portability
- applications of pointers with classes
- using pointers to allocate memory
- explanation of C strings vs C++ strings
- recursion.
- some searching algorithms - linear vs binary search
- backtracking and some initial ideas around graphs and path finding
- Terminal Commands - cd, dir, ls. 
- Output redirection (`>`)
- RGB values
- `.ppm` files
- Non-array data structures (Vectors, Stacks)
